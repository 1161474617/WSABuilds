## After installation 

#### Once installed, you can launch the sideloaded app from the Start Menu.



#### If you want to install bundle files, such as .apkm or .xapk, you can install [SAI](https://apkpure.com/split-apks-installer-sai/com.aefyr.sai) and use that to install bundle files, as well as regular APKs.
